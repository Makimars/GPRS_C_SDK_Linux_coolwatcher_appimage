[Ai-Thinker GPRS C SDK](https://github.com/Ai-Thinker-Open/GPRS-C-SDK) - Working Linux Appimage
=====


I made this fork because I was extremely frustrated getting the coolwatcher program for board flashin working. In the end, I managed to get it working by creating an appimage and bundled all the libraries there.

It is downloadable as a release on this fork.

Hope it helps someone.
